    "Emma lay beneath the glittering sky and sighed. \n Moonlight warmed her face. She dreamed of tiny hands offering cookies, words sharing secrets, and a blanket big enough for everyone. \n In her dream, sharing made lonely hearts sing and brought bright, laughing faces together. She woke, planned a sharing picnic soon.",
    "Emma found a jar of stardust glowing under her bed. \n She clutched it like a secret dream. Her friends peered in, eyes wide. \n At first Emma wanted to keep every sparkle. Then she breathed, opened the lid, and scattered lights. Laughter bloomed. Sharing made the night brighter. And hearts twinkled."
